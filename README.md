The master branch is Peter Madsens release.
The arberg branch is where I have added my own Powershell goodies. The one of the lines I've added will only work on my pc, because I start powershell in admin mode using RunAsSpc which I have placed here on my pc: c:\ToolsData\RunAsSpc\PowershellAdmin.spc
